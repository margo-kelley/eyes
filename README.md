# EYES

A game of Cat and Mouse. Move your mouse, the cat's eyes will follow. 
Intended only for a bit of fun and a good pun.


This was submitted as a project for MITxPro:

This is a more styled version of the original project, which was a simple eye animation that followed mouse movements.
This version includes cat-like eye shape, slit pupils, whiskers, and a triangular(ish) nose.


Known Issue: window resize skews top and bottom half of face away from each other.
